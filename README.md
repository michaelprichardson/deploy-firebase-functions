This package was designed help deploy more than [10 firebase functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/manage-functions#deploy_functions) at a time. It's extremely easy to use and just wraps the firebase-tool CLI and automically creates the commands to deploy 10 functions at a time.

### Installation

Node Package
You can install the deploy-firebase-functions CLI using npm (the Node Package Manager). Note that you will need to install Node.js and npm. Installing Node.js should install npm as well.

To download and install the CLI run the following command:
```sh
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
This will provide you with the globally accessible `deploy-firebase-functions` command.
